    <h1>VAE with Normalizing Flows Project</h1>
    <p>Enhancing Variational Autoencoder with Normalizing Flows using a Multivariate g-k Distribution and Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project aims to elevate the performance of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by integrating Normalizing Flows with a Multivariate g-k Distribution, optimized using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. The enhancements are applied to the MNIST dataset to improve the quality and diversity of generated images.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Components</h2>
        <h3>1. Multivariate g-k Distribution</h3>
        <p>The g-k distribution is used as the base distribution within the Normalizing Flows. This distribution is particularly powerful in modeling complex data structures, offering more flexibility than the standard normal distribution.</p>

        <h3>2. Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization</h3>
        <p>The parameters of the g-k distribution are fine-tuned using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, a robust technique for non-linear parameter estimation. This optimization enhances the flow’s ability to capture intricate patterns in the data, leading to superior performance in generation and reconstruction tasks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
        <p><strong>VAE Architecture:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encoder:</strong> Compresses input images from the MNIST dataset into a latent space.</li>
            <li><strong>Normalizing Flows:</strong> Applies invertible flows to transform the latent space, leveraging the g-k distribution as the foundational structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Decoder:</strong> Reconstructs images from the transformed latent space, aiming for high fidelity and diversity in the output.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, utilizing the enhanced latent space provided by Normalizing Flows and the g-k distribution. The result is a VAE capable of generating more realistic and complex image data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Visual Results</h2>

        <h3>1. VAE with Combined Flow</h3>
        <img src="output_74_0.png" alt="VAE with Combined Flow">
        <p>The generated images are blurry, with unclear digits, indicating poor performance in both image quality and clarity.</p>

        <h3>2. VAE-GAN</h3>
        <img src="output_81_0.png" alt="VAE-GAN">
        <p>Slightly better results than the first, but the generated images still lack detail and clarity, with many digits indistinct.</p>

        <h3>3. Basic Normalizing Flows and Multivariate g-k with LM Optimization</h3>
        <img src="output_87_0.png" alt="Basic Normalizing Flows and Multivariate g-k with LM Optimization">
        <p>This approach shows noticeable improvement, with clearer digit formation, though some images are still blurry and hard to distinguish.</p>

        <h3>4. Introducing Radial Flow with Multivariate g-k and LM Optimization</h3>
        <img src="output_93_0.png" alt="Introducing Radial Flow with Multivariate g-k and LM Optimization">
        <p>The final plot demonstrates the best results, with distinct, well-formed digits, clear separation, and overall higher quality of generated images.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Analysis of the Final Plot (Best Classification Result)</h2>
        <p>The final plot shows the best classification results:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clearer Classification:</strong> The data points in this new plot are distinctly grouped into three clusters, indicating that the model effectively separates different categories (likely different digits) in the latent space. This clustered distribution aids in clearer classification of different digits.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher Separation in Latent Space:</strong> The noticeable gaps between clusters suggest a higher degree of separation between different categories. This distribution is beneficial for accurately distinguishing and recognizing different categories during the generation process.</li>
            <li><strong>Tight Cluster Distribution:</strong> The data points within each cluster are tightly packed, indicating the model’s high consistency in generating samples of the same category, which helps reduce confusion between categories during generation.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison with Previous Plots:</strong> The final plot shows more distinct classification, with clearer clusters and gaps between them. This suggests that the new model may better differentiate between different digits in the generation task. While the new plot has a less extensive coverage of the latent space compared to previous plots, it offers more explicit and clear classification. Therefore, if the goal is to clearly distinguish between different categories of digits, the new result might be better.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>Sample Quality:</strong> The enhanced VAE model shows significant improvements in generating realistic and diverse images, particularly with Radial Flow combined with the multivariate g-k distribution and LM optimization.</p>
        <p><strong>Latent Space:</strong> The final plot demonstrates superior category separation and clearer classification, making it the most effective model configuration.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Results</h2>
